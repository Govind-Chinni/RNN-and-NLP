1. How does NER differ from POS tagging?
Ans:  Think of a sentence like:
	"Apple CEO Tim Cook visited New York in April."

      POS tagging (Part-of-Speech tagging) tells us the role of each word in the sentence.
      For example:
	   "Apple" → noun
	   "visited" → verb
	   "in" → preposition
      NER (Named Entity Recognition) goes a step further and identifies real-world things in the sentence.
      For example:
	"Apple" → ORGANIZATION
	"Tim Cook" → PERSON
	"New York" → LOCATION
	"April" → DATE

     * POS tagging labels grammar.
     * NER labels actual names, places, dates, etc.



2. Describe two applications that use NER in the real world (e.g., financial news, search engines).
Ans: Financial News Monitoring:
	Banks or stock traders use NER to extract entities like company names, stock tickers, or dates from headlines and articles.
		Example: From a headline like
			"Tesla announces new battery tech in Berlin on June 10"
		NER can pull:
			"Tesla" → ORGANIZATION
			"Berlin" → LOCATION
			"June 10" → DATE
	This helps automate alerts and decision-making.

	Search Engines & Assistants (Google, Siri):
	When you ask:
		"Who is the president of France?"
	NER helps the system recognize:
		"president" → title
		"France" → COUNTRY
	It then finds and ranks content with those specific entities, improving search accuracy.
